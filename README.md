I were able to get most tasks done and i have somewhat of a working result, however 
i where unable to get the register.js to fire after the validation. No matter what i tried i always got the result that "addEventListener is not a function" 
or a "button is null" if i had the functions chained after eachother. I tried various onload methods so that they would load after the HTML, but not none semed to fix the issue.
So now one can add empty classes unfortunatley because both functions trigger at the same time.

It was a bit hard to figure out what the tasks meant exactly, but i think my js class is correct, it is working as far as i know. 

validation accounts for the values listed in the task, but as mentioned earlier the register function overides and adds a result as i could not figure out how to chain them. 

I also did not understand the last question, but i got somewhat of a local storage sollution with a display locally stored and a remove. 

i also tried to make the contacts editable, as showed in the lecture, but the tlf number and email always switched places and i could not figure out how to solve that as well, 
so i opted out of having that in my sollution.
